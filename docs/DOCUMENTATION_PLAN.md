| # | Diagram or Artefact | Purpose and Rationale (links to brief) | Status | MoSCoW |
|---|---------------------|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| **1** | **System Context** | Frames the Flight Search Platform in relation to business-to-consumer and business-to-business users plus neighbouring systems (fifteen-plus supplier feeds, booking engine, loyalty integrations). Establishes boundaries and high-level data contracts. | Done | **Must** |
| **2** | **High-Level Runtime Architecture** | End-to-end data path: Ingestion → Kafka → Flink → NoSQL and Redis → API → Users. Meets the need for fresh pricing and sub-second response under fifty million daily searches. | Done | **Must** |
| **3** | **Data Flow and Decoupling (Topic Centric)** | Kafka topics (`supplier.raw`, `flights.enriched`, `cache.invalidate`) with producers and consumers. Highlights conflict resolution, anomaly detection and cache invalidation. | Pending | **Must** |
| **4** | **Search Request Sequence (Latency View)** | Swim-lane: User → API → Search Index → Redis hit or NoSQL miss. Annotated with p50 and p95 targets to evidence performance. | Done | **Must** |
| **5** | **Deployment and Fault Tolerance** | Three-AZ AWS layout plus resilience and scaling cheat-sheet (replication, partition counts) and Flink fail and recover mini sequence. | Pending | **Must** |
| **6** | **Data Lifecycle and Governance** | Raw Kafka events archived to S3 with lifecycle policy (Standard → Infrequent Access → Glacier) and curated Parquet for Athena. Covers regulatory retention and replay capability. | Pending | **Should** |
| **7** | **Non-Functional Requirements Matrix** | Table mapping availability, latency, throughput, retention and cost targets to design elements and validation methods. Completes non-functional coverage without another diagram. | Pending | **Should** |
| **8** | **Trade-Off Comparison Table** | Two-column table: hybrid real-time versus serverless batch plus cache, assessed on latency, operational effort, cost and risk. Provides design reasoning for stakeholders. | Pending | **Should** |
| **9** | **Flink Job Data Flow (Mini DAG)** | Zoom-in on enrichment pipeline: raw topic → normalise → deduplicate → enrich → upsert NoSQL then emit `cache.invalidate`. Demonstrates rule extensibility and exactly-once semantics. | Pending | **Could** |
| **10** | **Capability Map (Enterprise View)** | Business capabilities → application services → technology blocks. Useful for governance reviews; optional if time is limited. | Pending | **Could** |
